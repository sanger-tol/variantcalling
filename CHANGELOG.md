# sanger-tol/variantcalling: Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [[1.1.7](https://github.com/sanger-tol/variantcalling/releases/tag/1.1.7)] - Shang Tang (patch 7) - [2025-06-26]

### Enhancements & fixes

- Update Deepvariant to version 1.9.0 (conda-free)
- Add module [DEEPVARIANT_VCFSTATSREPORT](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/modules/nf-core/deepvariant/vcfstatsreport) to generate visual report from Deepvariant
- Compress and index concatenated VCFs

### Software dependencies

Note, since the pipeline is using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is entirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been listed below for reference. Only `Docker` or `Singularity` containers are supported, `conda` is not supported.

| Dependency  | Old version | New version |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Deepvariant | 1.6.1       | 1.9.0       |
| HTSlib      |             | 1.21        |

## [[1.1.0](https://github.com/sanger-tol/variantcalling/releases/tag/1.1.0)] - Shang Tang - [2023-12-20]

### Enhancements & fixes

- Updated the CI procedure to use "sanger-tol" rather than "nf-core" names.
- Renamed Sanger related Github CI test workflows.
- nf-core template was updated from 2.7 to 2.8.
- Removed BAM/CRAM index files from the sample sheets.
- Made fasta index file optional from the inputs.
